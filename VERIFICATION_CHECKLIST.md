## 🎯 What Should Happen on Vercel

### Build Log (Vercel Dashboard → Build Logs):
```
✅ Installing dependencies...
✅ Running "npm run build"...
✅ dist/ created successfully
✅ Deployment complete
```

### After Deployment:
1. Visit your live URL (e.g., https://yourname-mumbai-hacks.vercel.app/)

   - ✅ 4 team members (NOT 5)
   - ✅ All in one row on desktop
   - ✅ All images visible
   - ✅ No empty 5th column
   - ✅ No broken image icons

---

## 🚨 If Images STILL Don't Show

### Debug Step 1: Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look at network requests
5. Search for "nikhil.png"

**If you see:**
- ✅ `200 OK` → Image loaded successfully
- ❌ `404 Not Found` → Image path is wrong
- ❌ `No request` → Image src not pointing to URL

### Debug Step 2: Check Console Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red errors about images
4. Screenshot the error and share it

### Debug Step 3: Inspect Element
1. Right-click on broken image
2. Select "Inspect" 
3. Look at the `src` attribute
4. Should be `/nikhil.png` or similar

## 🔧 Force Refresh Vercel

If you believe changes were pushed but not deployed:

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy
```bash
# Using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod --force
```

### Option 2: Clear Cache and Redeploy
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings
2. Scroll to "Deployments"
3. Click "Redeploy with cache cleared"

### Option 3: Check Git Sync
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings
2. Go to "Git" section
3. Verify repo is connected to main branch
4. It should auto-deploy on `git push`

---

## 📝 Git Status Check

Before Vercel redeploy, verify all changes are pushed:

```bash
# Check if everything is committed
git status
# Should show: "On branch main" and "nothing to commit"

# Check if everything is pushed
git log --oneline -5
# Should show your commits

# Verify images exist on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/Nikhil-Rao20/Mumbai_Hacks/tree/main/public
# Should see all 4 image files
```

---

## 🎉 Success = You Will See

## 📞 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Images 404 on Vercel but work locally | Missing vercel.json or wrong paths | Ensure vercel.json exists and image paths have `/` |
| 5th empty column still visible | Grid not updated | Verify `lg:grid-cols-4` in LandingPage.jsx |
| Vercel says "public not found" | Images not committed to Git | Run `git add public/` and `git commit` |
| Build fails on Vercel | Syntax error in vercel.json | Check JSON is valid (no trailing commas) |
| Can't find files on GitHub | Branch is wrong | Make sure you pushed to main, not other branch |
